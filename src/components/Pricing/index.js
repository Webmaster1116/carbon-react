                        <TextSubtitle>We plan to use approximately 65% of your purchase price to fund forest management activities, social innovation opportunities and other local costs. <br />This gives the forest the option to pursue the registration process for a traditional carbon offset program.</TextSubtitle>
                        <TextSubtitle>Please note, according to <CustomLink href='https://winrock.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Transaction-costs.pdf' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pearson et al</CustomLink>, traditional carbon offset projects spend 0.3 to 270% of your purchase price on transaction costs. <br />The upper end of this range implies that when you buy a traditional carbon offset you may be funding the intermediaries while the government is subsidizing the forest. <br />We believe the excessive overhead for traditional carbon offsets does not justify the added accuracy provided by manual measurements for healthy, remote, mature forests. <CustomLink href='https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/25/carbon-offset-consultancy-fees' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><br />We believe â‚¬25,000 for two of many site visits for a compliance process is excessive</CustomLink> and unaffordable for many mature forestry projects that have predictable carbon sequestration rates. <text style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}><br />We value common sense conservation over non-inclusive regulation.</text></TextSubtitle>
                        <TextSubtitle>We believe a better approach to monetize healthy, remote, mature forests is to accept budgetary measurement accuracy for predictable forestry projects, using satellite imagery alone. <br />This eliminates excessive costs for unaffordable manual measurements that seek definitive accuracy for a well understood, low risk, predictable carbon sink. <br />Conversely, definitive measurement accuracy is critically important for new, high risk, unpredictable CO<CustomSub>2</CustomSub> extraction devices whose sequestration efficiency is unproven. <br />Using satellite imagery alone to estimate carbon sequestration rates for predictable carbon sinks enables a larger percentage of your purchase price to benefit the project rather than fund non value added intermediaries.</TextSubtitle>
